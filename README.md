# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS
## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Get the four coordinate values from the user
### Step 2: 
Use import.math to assign the distance formula
### Step 3:
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
Round the value up to two decimal values and the print values it would be calculated
### Step 5: 
End the program
### PROGRAM:
~~~

import math
x1=10
y1=6
x2=4
y2=2
d= math.sqrt((x2-x1)**2 + (y2-y1)**2)
e=round(d,2)
print(e)
~~~  
### OUTPUT:
